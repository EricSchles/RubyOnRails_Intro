--[app name] will be the name of your application's main class so:
[app name]::application.routes.draw do will be at the top of routes.rb

--creates a controller with name [controller name] and an index

Write your controller "sub routes": 

open app/controllers/[controller name]_controller.rb

def [sub_route]
end

--notice this is a method name and anything on that page will be defined in
this method.
